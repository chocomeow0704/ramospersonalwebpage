My parents are Benjie Acierto Ramos and Joy Valiente Ramos, I also have a little brother who is 11 years younger than me, his name is Santino Benjamin Ramos.
<br>
Recently I joined my family to live here at Cavite, I had been away from them for almost 10 years. We would only see each other during Summer and Christmas breaks.
<br>
Although I grew up not being with them, I still love them dearly. The bonds between us had never been broken. 
<br>
It is also evident that I am more of a papa's girl due to the optimism of my father that I love so much. My father is also less strict  than my  mother.
<br>
But I still respect them equally for they are more superior than anyone else.
