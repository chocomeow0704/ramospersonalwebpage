&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our friendship started maybe on the midst of our first year in LaSalle. We grew very fond of each other for 3 years now, that is why we are so comfortable with each one another.
We love going to trips or "walwal", we had been to Laguna, Tagaytay and Manila National Museum. There is also this rule in our "barkada" that if we curse or "mura" we are going to pay 5 pesos.
From the collected taxes we were able to fund our trips to different places and also there is this one time that we used the fund to rent a videoke room and it was very fun.
